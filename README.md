# Granular Collapse Simulation (PreGrad Thesis Code)

This repository contains the Python code developed for my Civil Engineering thesis:  
**"NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF A MONO-DISPERSE COLLAPSE USING THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD"**.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- [FEniCS Project](https://fenicsproject.org/) (finite element framework)
- NumPy / Matplotlib (for numerical routines and plotting)

This project contains the implementation of a numerical model for the collapse of a granular column using the Shallow Water Equations (SWE) adapted to granular media. The code is written in Python and built on the FEniCS finite element framework, allowing the simulation of depth-averaged dynamics of granular flows. By introducing basal friction terms inspired by granular rheology, the model is able to reproduce the characteristic mound-like morphology that emerges after granular collapse, in contrast with fluid-like spreading observed in water column collapse.

The repository includes both the source code and the full thesis document, which describes the physical background, numerical formulation, and validation process. This work aims to contribute to the growing interest in applying continuum models—such as SWE—to granular flows, as an alternative to more computationally expensive Discrete Element Methods (DEM). The approach highlights the potential of finite element methods to capture complex granular behavior with reduced computational cost.

Developed as part of my undergraduate thesis in Civil Engineering.
